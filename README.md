# _Programming Language Selector Quiz_

#### _Description and Creation Date_
* created on 23 October, 2020
* the project is a five quesiton quiz
* uses a tiny bit of branching to point the user towards his/her/their next coding language to learn
* hopes to entertain and just have a few buttons work **as opposed to being actual advice about what to learn**

#### Authored by _**Tyler Sinks**_

## Description

_In order to practice and apply the tools from the Epicodus Week 1 and Week 2 curriculum, I, a current student at said school, was tasked with the creation of a page of this nature._
**This project page**
* uses tidbits of both Bootstrap and jQuery to achieve its look and functionality
* limits possible suggested coding languages to learn to Python, JavaScript, and Ruby
* takes in responses from a user via five questions
* once all responses are entered, &mdash; and optionally, one's name &mdash; a button must be pressed to see which coding language this page's algorithm suggests
* quiz question topics include, _but are not limited to:_
1. existing leanings towards learning a specific language
2. favorite movie(s)
3. personality traits

## How To Set Up This Project

**System Requirements**
1. a working computer with a web browser installed
2. a connection to the internet
3. enough hard drive space to save the entire repo, if close inspection of its contents are desired.
4. _software:_ a text editor (egs. Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Atom, Notepad, _VIM_ &mdash; for the daring &mdash; etc.)
5. _more optional software:_ a terminal, shell, or bash system with which one might command git to do his/her/their bidding

**To Put This Project Right Onto Your Machine**
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository that holds the component files: [Tyler's language-suggestOR repository](https://github.com/sinkstyt/language-suggestOR)
2. *briefly* peruse this README.md just to see what you might be getting into
3. Click "CLONE" - a button near the top right of the GitHub repository's page.
4. Launch and use your terminal, z-shell, or bash to first navigate to where this project will live on your device (eg. Users/{YOUR_USER_ID}/desktop, in case you want it in your face every time your operating system plops you on your desktop)
5. Use the following commands to bring on down this gem of a project:
* `git clone {HERES_WHERE_YOU_PASTE_IN_THE_HTTP_URL_SO_NICELY_PUT_ONTO_YOUR_CLIPBOARD_WITH_THAT_CLIPBOARD_BUTTON_WHICH_SHOWS_UP_after_YOU_HAVE_HIT_CLONE_ON_THE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_PAGE}`
* press ENTER or RETURN
* then, once your terminal informs you this download has completed, launch the whole thing with your text editor of choice. An example terminal command:
`code .` (this launches the whole kaboodle of files and folders in Visual Studio Code if you have configured your shell/terminal/bash to launch said text editor with command `code`)

**Alternatively,**
1. Just web-browse _Remember when we used to say, 'surf'?_ over to the index page. And here is a link you could click now to do just that:
<a href="http://sinkstyt.github.io/language-suggestOR/index.html"></a>

## No additional codebases or libraries need to be installed to view the page nicely

## Known Bugs

_The project site is currently functioning in the only browser it has so far been tested: Google Chrome Version 86.0.4240.111 (Official Build) (x86_64)_
_No cross-browser bugs are anticipated, but please let the project's maintainer(s) know of these, if you would be so kind.

## Support and Contact

_Creator of this project welcomes additions, suggestions, comments, and queries to be directed towards <tyler.sinks@gmail.com>_
_I welcome and encourage additions to this code. More specifically, I would be delighted to get commentary on the scripts.js file_

## Technologies Used

_Bootstrap assisted with ~~some~~ **most** of the styling_
_jQuery assisted with selecting page content and have the page actually do something_
